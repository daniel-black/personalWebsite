  <h1>Dan Black</h1>
  <p>
    Hi there! My name is Dan and this is my corner of the Internet. I'm currently a 
    senior computer engineering student at the University of Minnesota. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After graduating in the spring of 2022, I will be working full-time as a software
    engineer at <a href="https://www.chrobinson.com/en/">CH Robinson
    </a> working on the <a href="https://www.freightquote.com/">Freightquote</a> 
    application.
  </p>
  
  <p>I enjoy reading and learning about history, technology, and startups.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am reading <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/195157026X/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2CQJCKSGLQ4KJ&keywords=meditations+marcus+aurelius&qid=1636678145&s=books&sprefix=meditation%2Cstripbooks%2C202&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQlZYWVpZMUlJMDI0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTAwNDAyMTZVSkdCRVFJRVBVRCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjgyMjIzM01SWjg5RU02UUk1USZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=">Meditations</a> by Marcus Aurelius</span></p>

    I infrequently write on my blog <a href="https://briefmusic.substack.com/">Brief Music</a>.
    The name comes from the last passage in the aformentioned <i>Last and First Men</i> which I'll just drop below because I like it so much.
    (Context: one of the last members of humankind is recounting the legacy of humanity in the face of certain extinction at the hands of a dying sun)
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "But one thing is certain. Man himself, at the very least, is music,
    a brave theme that makes music also of its vast accompaniment, its
    matrix of storms and stars. Man himself in his degree is eternally
    a beauty in the eternal form of things. It is very good to have been
    man. And so we may go forward together with laughter in our hearts,
     and peace, thankful for the past, and for our own courage. For we
    shall make after all a fair conclusion to this <strong>brief music</strong> that is man."
